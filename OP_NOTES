Foundry
=======
*) To build code
mvn -Pprod clean install

check if any dispatcher and/or consumer processes are already running. If so kill them.

Also check if the activemq is running via

ps -ef | grep activemq

otherwise start it with 

sudo activemq start


Start dispatcher
----------------
bin/dispatcher.sh

The script displays the location of its log file and runs the dispatcher in the background via nohup.

The dispatcher configuration file is at

Foundry/dispatcher/src/main/resources/prod/cinergi-dispatcher-cfg-pipe-stage.xml

Start consumer head process 
---------------------------
bin/consumer_head.sh

The script displays the location of its log file and runs the comsumer head in the background via nohup.

The consumer head config file is at

Foundry/consumers/src/main/resources/prod/cinergi-consumers-cfg-pipe-stage.xml

In this file each enhancer in the pipeline is configured. The configuration parameters specific to each enhancer and of interests are under <params> tag of each
enhancer.


*) to manage processing
--------------------
bin/manager.sh

type help on the prompt to see available commands

Available commands
	help - shows this message.
	ingest <src-nif-id>
	h - show all command history
	delete <url> - [e.g. http://localhost:9200/nif]
	dd <sourceID>  - delete docs for a sourceID
	trigger <sourceID> <status-2-match> <queue-2-send> [<new-status>] (e.g. trigger nif-0000-00135 new.1 foundry.uuid.1)
	status [<sourceID>] - show processing status of data source(s)
	list - lists all of the existing sources.
	exit - exits the management client.

to start ingesting, first list all the registered sources via

list

Then select an id from the registered source list e.g.

ingest cinergi-0001

to check the processing status use status command. If no source id is given it list the processing status of each source.


Processing Results
------------------
All processed ISO documents are stored at /data/waf directory. 

To serve the processed WAF files you need to copy the contents of the /data/waf directory after processing to 

centos@132.249.238.151:/data/apache-tomcat-7.0.68/webapps/cinergi/waf 
remote directory.

Misc 
----
Stopword list location

/var/data/cinergi/stoplist.txt

This is read at startup by the consumer_head.

Generating Source Description Files
-----------------------------------
A list of currently available source descriptor files is at 
Foundry/consumers/etc directory (e.g. cinergi-0001.json)

If the resource already exists you need first delete its data from 
the mongodb running bin/manager.sh and executing delete data (dd) command

dd cinergi-0001

After that you need to remove the old source descriptor also via

./ingest_src_cli.sh -j $HOME/Foundry/consumers/etc/cinergi-0001.json -d

in $HOME/Foundry/bin directory. 

Then save the new source descriptor the the mongodb via

./ingest_src_cli.sh -j $HOME/Foundry/consumers/etc/cinergi-0001.json





Cinergi Annotator
=================

Cinergi Annotator is on centos@132.249.238.151 under /home/centos/cinergi-annotator

Building the code 
-----------------
grails clean; grails war

Deploy to Tomcat
----------------
./stop.sh
./deploy.sh
./start.sh
